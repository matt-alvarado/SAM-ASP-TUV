According to Section 5.3, the wet removal rate constant for below cloud
pollutants is the following (written in LaTeX form):

B_{bel} = 8x10^{-5}(1.0-F_{b})

B_{bel} = rate constant (s^{-1})
F_{b} = Fraction of the pollutant layer above cloud bottom.

However, according to the software, if the "Gas definition" flag is on,
these values can be neglected.  At Line #4796 of hymodelc.F, if "dogas" is on,
the values for WetIn/WetLo can be neglected (since they get set to 0.)   

Type: Float (real) 
Default Value: 0.0
