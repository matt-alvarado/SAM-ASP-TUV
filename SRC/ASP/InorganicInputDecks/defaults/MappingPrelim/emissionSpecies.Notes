This variable is the pollutant emission rate in units per hour.  I believe the "units"
parameter is referring either to volume units or mass units, depending on how the 
dovol flag is set.

The sample data for the test case has emission rates of 1.0 units/hour for the
following components in the "gear" mechanism:
- AERO
- Ethanol
- NO
- ISOP
- SO2
- NO2
- Formaldehyde
- CO
- ALD2
- PAR
- OLE
- ETH
- Toluene
- XYL (xylene itself?)
- Methanol

The following have emission rates of 1.0 units/hour in the EBI mechanism:
- NO2
- NO
- CO
- Formaldehyde
- ALD2
- PAR
- OLE
- Ethanol
- Toluene
- CRES
- XYL (xylene itself?)
- ISOP
- SO2
- SULF

The following species are not contained in the CB4 mechanism but show emission rates
of 1.0:
- SO4A (non-CB4)
- NH3G (non-CB4)
- NH4G (non-CB4, but I don't recall this sort of hypervalent compound being isolated?)
- NH4A (non-CB4)
- NO3A (non-CB4)
