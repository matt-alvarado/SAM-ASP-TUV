!! Based on MELAM by Donnan Steele, 2000-2004 (c)
!! This is the gas phase mechanism input deck for MELAM.
!! Each chemical must be typed the same way each time, and 
!! must match one of the chemicals in GasPhaseChems.in
!! Use + to connote reation, an unreacting M to indicate pressure 
!! dependence, and => to signify the reactant / product boundary
!! You can use stoichiometric factors (you must put whitespace
!! between the factor and the chemical).
!!
!! After specifying the reaction, put a semi-colon and specify the
!! appropriate rate coefficients, delimited by reaction type, 
!! 
!! Refer to water as "H2O" - although don't specify it in the chemical lists.
!!
!!  For photolytic reactinos, assume that the reaction rate is proportional to 
!!  concentration.  Additional dependencies may later be added, such as interactive 
!!  radiation (11/01).  So:
!!                1. Reaction Rate (sec^-1)
!!
!!  Two body Reactions Assume the Arrheneous Form:
!!	k = A *  exp(-B/T)
!!  All units are appropriate combinations of moles, cm, seconds, and K.
!!  So, specify:  1. "A": Reaction Rate at 298 (M^(-n+1) s^-1)
!!		  2. "B": Temperature Dependence (Ea / R(K))
